         This center is a specialized center which enable students to develop skills in electric vehicle autonomous connected cars technology. Electric vehicles hold significant potential for not only transforming how the world moves, but also for increasing energy security and reducing carbon emissions and other pollutants. Transportation accounts for about one-fifth of global energy use, and passager vehicles account for about ten percent of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions. With the rapid rise in personal vehicle wonership around the globe, demand for fuel will continue to increase along with carbon emissions unless there is a shift in transportation. There are a variety of clean vehicle technologies and fuels in development and in use, but electric vehicles represent one of the most promising technologies for reducing oil use and cutting emissions. This market is still developing, however, and there are many challenges, particularly with technology integration, optimization, and scale-up.</p>
